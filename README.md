# Best Burgers React App

This is the Ruby on Rails API for my React Burgers App. After cloning, cd into the file and run these commands to start the server:

$ bundle install

$ rake db:migrate

$ rake db:seed

$ rails s

This app is the frontend for my Best Burgers React App using ReactJS/Redux and connecting to a Ruby on Rails API. It's a simple tracking app that lets you input new restaurants and burgers.

## Usage

First, make sure the backend server is running. After cloning the frontend, cd into the project directory and run:

$ npm install

$ npm start

The app will ask for another port. Type "y" and it should open in the browser at "http://localhost:3001/".
